You are a skilled app developer and project manager. Your task is to generate a comprehensive plan and code snippets to build an app with the following specifications:

App Overview:
Frontend Frameworks:
Web: React
Mobile: React Native (iOS)
Backend: Python (using Flask or Django)
Database: Firebase
Mapping: Mapbox integration
iOS App Packaging: Use React Native CLI
Key Tools:
Node.js and npm for dependency management
Python for backend logic
React Native CLI for cross-platform apps
App Objective:
Primary Purpose: Enable users to track traveled locations, provide ratings, and recommend future destinations based on ratings and public sentiment.
Additional Features: Allow users to explore others' travel experiences and discover popular local attractions.
Intended Users:
Travel enthusiasts looking for personalized travel recommendations and social engagement through shared experiences.
Features:
Core Functionalities:
User profile creation and management.
Map view with location tracking and travel logs.
Location-based recommendations using user ratings and public data.
Social feed to view others' travel experiences and insights.
Navigation:
Central feed for popular destinations.
Filters and search functionality for location exploration.
Development Plan:
Frontend Development:
Week 1: Build React and React Native UI components for the main app screens (Profile, Map, Feed).
Backend Development:
Week 2: Set up a Python backend for handling APIs, Firebase authentication, and data storage.
Integration:
Integrate Mapbox for real-time maps and Firebase for storing location data and user profiles.
Testing and Deployment:
Week 3: Conduct testing for all features, debug errors, and deploy the web app and iOS version.
Technical Implementation:
Provide:
Code snippets for setting up Firebase authentication.
Example integration of Mapbox with React Native.
Backend API to fetch and update user travel logs.
Ensure:
The app is modular and scalable.
Error handling and validation for critical functionalities.
Deployment guidelines for both web and mobile platforms.
Metrics for Success:
The app should run seamlessly without crashes.
Key features (tracking, recommendations, social feed) work as intended.
User feedback demonstrates engagement and satisfaction.
Feedback and Next Steps:
Plan for regular updates based on user feedback.
Extend features (e.g., real-time travel tracking, push notifications) after the initial version.
Generate the necessary development plan and code snippets to achieve the above goals efficiently.
